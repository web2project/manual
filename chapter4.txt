# Best Practices

## Security Considerations

At the time of this writing, there are no known issues with the latest Web2project release (v3.1.0) but there are three primary steps which have been taken to prevent most issues.

# First, we filter all input with the assumption that it is not safe by default.
# Next, we implemented a simple .htaccess script modeled after Drupal’s .htaccess. This prevents anyone from accessing files other than an enumerated list.
# Finally, since the first solution was only effective in an Apache environment, we have inserted a simple sentinel function to prevent unauthorized access.

Regardless of the above steps, care should be taken to limit ftp and database access to authorized and trusted individuals and to ensure that your directory and file permissions are configured properly.

W> Turn off register_globals. This feature has been deprecated as of 5.3 and removed as of 5.4. It should not exist as an option any more.

W> Damage caused to your Web2project system by granting inappropriate access to individuals are usually due to your organization’s practices and absolutely nothing to do with Web2project.

## Maintenance

The only maintenance for Web2project is the Queue Scanner. If you enable the queuing of email notifications, a cron task must be configured to hit this file on a regular basis. This script will parse the queue every 10 minutes and can be adjusted as necessary:

*/10	* * * *	wget –O - -w http://{web2project-install}/queuescanner.php

There are no other maintenance tasks required by Web2project. It is strongly suggested that you apply your MySQL tuning and maintenance tasks to the Web2project database in accordance with your current policies.

## Backup

The most direct and simplest way to backup Web2project is to use MySQL’s built in mysqldump command. For further information on this utility and its usage, please reference the MySQL Users’ Manual. While every organization’s practices will vary depending on their requirements and capabilities, it is suggested to back up your Web2project database on a regular basis.
