# Introduction

This manual was initially written in reference to Web2project v3.1.0 and has been updated to incorporate the features, fixes, and changes through 3.2.0. While much of it will be applicable to the entire 3.x series, you may notice certain differences in functionality and features. As new major releases of Web2project become available, an effort will be made to keep this manual up to date in a timely manner.

All screenshots were taken from the production system currently in use by CaseySoftware, LLC using the default Web2project style. Therefore, certain details concerning companies, projects, and tasks have been purposely obfuscated from screenshots to protect potentially sensitive information.

## Conventions used in this Manual

As with any open source project, Web2project development often reaches a fast and furious pace as new individuals and organizations get involved. As a result, there are always various versions of Web2project available for download in addition to the master branch. Sometimes these versions change behavior or system settings so to make these points clear, weâ€™ve added this notation:

W> There are times throughout your Web2project usage where you could inadvertently cause problems for yourself later. It is strongly suggested that you read these sections with care and follow the relevant directions precisely.

Q> During the years of Web2project support and development, a number of questions have been asked repeatedly by numerous users from around the world. While we work to resolve and simplify these items to eliminate these questions, some are more important and difficult to resolve than others and will be noted here.

D> These are features planned for future development but have little to no supporting functionality in place. They are mentioned here only for reference purposes to describe the overall direction of Web2project.

I> Features available in `develop` branch are denoted by this. The development version always has the latest and greatest features, fixes, and functionality as this is the code which developers are actively working in on a day to day basis. Unfortunately, this means it has not been through the testing and review the official releases receive. Unless you are a core Web2project contributor, an advanced PHP developer, or are willing to live with instability, it is strongly recommended that you do not use this code for production systems and instead consider it a preview of future features.
