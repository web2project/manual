# Themes & Styling

The current release of Web2project is not the easiest thing to customize. There are many aspects – such as the table layouts – which are hard-coded in the page generation. In many areas, the color of various screens, the font type and size, along with a few other aspects can be easily changed. In order to learn the flexibility of the Themes, click on System Admin, Default User Preferences, and then change the User Interface Style. These are the base styles available within the distribution and more styles are always under development.

There is an effort underway to convert the entire system to XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.0 compliant. Once this effort is complete and made available to the community, the vast majority of the system will be easily theme-able with a handful of CSS tweaks and modifications.

This is the beginning of the templating layer for web2project. Any HTML used within the core system will be contained within this directory. Each of these templates will be included within their modules similar to any other templating layer with a snippet like this:

include $AppUI->getTheme()->resolveTemplate('companies/list');

which resolves to this file by default:

./styles/_common/companies/list.php

If you wish to customize this for your needs, create a file such as this:

./styles/(your theme)/companies/list.php

Once you select your preferred theme (via the user preferences), your custom file will override the default _common file automatically with no additional configuration. This same principle can be applied to all addedit, view, list, and subview templates.

In some cases, the module-specific template may be overridden by a generic system-wide template such as:

./styles/_common/list.php

This generic template can be overriden in the same manner.
