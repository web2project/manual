## Links {#module-links}

The links module is an alternative resource where you can store quick links for reference and assign them to [Projects](/modules/projects.html) or [Task](/modules/tasks.html).

This is particularly useful to store client or vendor websites, but can be used for a number of purposes including links to external project files.

### Links List View (Links Index)

The links index page contains a number of tabs which can be defined via the system administration > Lookup Values. These tabs are used primarily to help you categorize all of your link resources so you can access them quickly.

For each tab there is a table which contains a list of available links along with usefull information about the link.

From this page you can:

* Add a new link
* View existing links
* Edit a link.
* View the project the link(s) are assigned to
* View a short description
* View the category
* View the task (if any)
* View who owns the links
* View the date and time the link was added.
