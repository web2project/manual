## Forums {#module-forums}

One of the simple ways to improve tracking of your Project is to ensure that all relevant discussion, communications, etc are attached to the Project. To make this process easier, Web2project has a simple threaded forum system built-in. It is not as advanced or flexible as some systems such as phpBB or vBulletin but since it is part of Web2project, it will automatically have the same look and feel in addition to all the security and permissions benefits.

### Create a Forum

Click on “Forums” in the top navigation and you should see a list of existing Forums in your system. From there simply click the “new forum” on the far right of your screen. This will take you to a screen where you name the forum, attach it to a Project, select an Owner, and assign a moderator. Since Project Permissions apply here, attaching the Forum to a Project ensures that your Project information is protected as expected. 
Create a Thread
Once you have a forum, you can begin to create threads. A thread is simply a line of discussion based on a topic. Any number of responses can be attached to the topic and anyone with proper permissions can respond as necessary. These responses can be browsed by Date, Thread, or contributor.

### Forum / Thread Watch

The most important aspect of the entire Forum module is the ability to set “Watches”. When an individual sets a watch on a thread or an entire forum, Web2project will automatically notify them each and every time there is a new comment. This ensures that the relevant information gets to the interested people as fast as possible with minimal effort.
