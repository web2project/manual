# Getting Started

## The Admin Account

W> After successful installation, immediately log in as admin and change the default password. Do not consider the system secure until you have changed the default admin password.

To change the password, log in and select User Admin from the navigation menu to see all active users in your system. Simply click the username and then click the "change password" button in the upper right corner. This will show a small popup screen allowing you to set a new password.

## Create a Company

Now it is time to create your first company. The fastest way is to click Company from the top navigation menu and then click the “New Company” button on the far right. This screen is where you fill in basic information on your organization. Nearly everything in the system – Projects, Users, Contacts, Files, Forums, and even Permissions – is attached to a Company.

Within CaseySoftware, much of the work is for other organizations. Creating a Company entry for each organization is a simple way of organizing Projects and limiting Permissions and respecting privacy and confidentiality requirements. Before you deploy Web2project for your organization, you should carefully consider your information security needs.

Once you save, you will be ready to continue. At any time, you can click back on the Company link and see all companies in the system and optionally filter by Company Owner.

Q> If you believe your company has disappeared, check the Owner Filter in upper right-hand corner as most likely you have changed this filter to a different user. Just change it to “All” and all Companies to which you have permissions to view will appear.

## Create Users & Permissions

Now that we have a Company, we can start creating Users. The creation of Users is a two step process. First, you must create the User within the User Admin. You give them a Login Name (case insensitive), a password, and fill in basic profile information including their Company. Clicking “submit” at this point will create the User.

Next, you must activate the User by assigning a specific Role. The four default Roles within Web2project are sufficient for the vast majority of projects and organizations but additional permissions and roles can be created as necessary. Project Worker is the most commonly used Role in most organizations as it allows a User to have complete access to all non-administration modules.

For example, if you have a contractor working on a single project and you wish to deny access to all other projects, you can apply the Project Worker Role and then add the description “Deny on All Projects” and “Allow” to the specific project. More information and detailed explanations of Roles and Permissions are found in Permissions 201.

Q> If you have created a new User and they cannot log in, check to make sure they have a Role assigned. No user can log in without a Role.

## Create a Project

Now you are ready to create your first Project. The easiest way is to click Project from the navigation menu and then click the “New Project” button on the far right. Alternatively, on any screen within Web2project, a simple dropdown – as pictured – can allow you quick access to immediately create new items throughout the system.

As you create Projects, it is important to choose a unique color. This color becomes useful as it will designate the project on the Calendar, on Users’ Todo lists, and elsewhere throughout the system. Next, select a specific Project Owner and Company. This becomes increasingly important as your permission and management requirements grow over time. Remember that anyone who has the correct permissions can return to this screen and edit the Project, so most decisions made when a project is created can be reconsidered and changed without difficulty at a later stage.

Once you fill in the information relevant to your Project, click “submit” to return to the project list. Remember, if you believe your project has disappeared, check the Owner and Company filters in upper right-hand corner. This is one of the most common problems new users face.

Q> If you believe your project has disappeared, check the Owner or Company filters in upper right-hand corner as most likely you have changed one of them. Just change both to “All” and all Projects to which you have permissions to view will appear.

## Create & Assign Tasks

Creating your first task can be daunting if you are not prepared. The first time you click “New Task”, you face a basic information screen with four tabs. The best way to get started is to name the task, select the “Dates” tab to fill in Start and End dates and a Duration, and select “Human Resources” to assign individuals. Once you select “Save”, email notifications will be generated to everyone except the Task Creator. To better understand the purpose of the other tabs and information, please refer to the Creating Tasks section.

## Task List

The most commonly used interface in the entire system is the “Todo List”. The default installation has this as all users’ first screen after Login.

The columns represent the Task name, the color-coded Project name, and finally the color-coded date information. The color-coded date information is by far the most important aspect and represents the status of the Task itself. The four colors represent “Future Tasks” (white), “Started and on time” (green), “Should have started” (peach), and “Overdue” (red). This is an efficient way to monitor all your assigned open tasks and review deadlines across all Tasking. As a System Administrator, you can also choose to view other users’ lists.

## Task Logs

To work on a Task, simply click “log” to the left of the Task name. If you are actively working on the Task now, click on the “Start” button. DotProject itself will start counting up the minutes. Once you are done, click “Stop”, fill in a comment, change the Progress if applicable, and click “Update Task”. You will immediately see the Task Overview screen with a complete list of all Task Logs.

## Reporting

The most commonly used Report is the “Task Log Report” (pictured below). It gives a single view showing all Task Logs over a specific date range. This report is useful for creating invoices or additional daily, weekly, or even monthly task tracking. Click “Reports”, “existing”, “Task Log”, select a Project, a User, and the date range to view all activity during that time.

The next most common report is the “Project Statistics Report”. This gives an overview of a the status of a project including completed, in progress, and overdue tasks. In addition, it shows a simple breakdown of everyone’s hours on the project. This is a simple way of monitoring the overall health of a project – or all projects – without having to review each one.

There are a number of other reports available within Web2project. Some of them may suit your organization’s requirements but many will not. Therefore, it is recommended to carefully evaluate your reporting needs and determine where the existing reports work or do not work for your organization. A deeper discussion of reporting is available in the Reporting section.
