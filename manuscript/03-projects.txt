## Projects {#module-projects}

The entire point of Web2project is to provide a single place where a team can come together to collaborate and share information on a project. Therefore, the bulk of a project manager’s time will be spent working in the Project and Task modules. All other modules, tools and functionality are based on these two concepts and therefore they are considered the most powerful and sometimes complex modules within the entire system. The best part in all of this is a simple fact: Although this advanced functionality is available, it does not need to be used. The functionality you enable and use within Web2project will determine its behavior and usefulness.

### Creating a Project

Creating your first Project is a deceptively simple task. By clicking “Project” on the navigation bar and then clicking “New Project” on the right or by selecting “New Project” from the upper-right dropdown (pictured), you will immediately be taken to the New Project Screen.

First, you should always give your Project a distinctive name and color. This will help distinguish it throughout the system for both you and your users. Next, you must assign it to a Company. For many organizations, all projects will be assigned to the customer’s company for easier permissions management, but your organization may have different requirements. Next, every project will have an Owner. By default this will be the person who created the project, but it can be changed to any active user in the system. Being the Owner of a Project does not confer any specific functionality, authority, or even permissions at this time.

Next, all Projects have a Status. Status is a way of identifying and grouping Projects regardless of their currently assigned Company. Whenever you look at the Project List screen, the Status will determine on which tab the project is displayed. The Status will be used to track a project throughout its lifetime. 

Next, you can choose to Import Tasks. This allows you to create project template which allows for any project to begin with an existing set of tasks which just have to be assigned to the specific dates and participants. Alternatively, templates can be imported repeatedly to create distinct task groups. Within CaseySoftware, the most common template is called a “Phase Template” which encapsulates an entire development phase from Requirements Discovery to Development to Delivery. By importing this repeatedly, multiple development phases can be established and scheduled as necessary. 

The rest of the fields available are purely for display purposes and not related to the current functionality of the system. For example, the Target and Actual Budgets are available for editing but are not updated or tracked anywhere in the system. The two URLs (URL, Staging URL) are references to external websites which might be relevant to a project. They will not normally point to websites or pages internal to your Web2project.

Finally, your new Project must be saved by clicking “submit”. If for some reason, you have made a mistake in creating your project, you can edit or even delete it from the View Project page if you have the proper permissions.

I> There are five major features currently implemented in Head concerning Project Templates.
First, there are two primary date options:
Selecting an Offset Date allows you to specify an arbitrary date in the future for the project to begin and Web2project will sequentially schedule all start and end dates into the future from this point.
Selecting an End Date does the exact opposite. After choosing an End Date for your project, Web2project will schedule all tasks from the end of the project backwards into the past resulting in an estimated start date.
Next, there are three different import options:
“Keep Assignees” will preserve the assignments of all the users within the imported project. No notifications are generated, but if you have laid out the assignments in advance, there is nothing further to do.
“Import related files” does exactly what it describes. This comes in useful when you have forms, checklists, etc attached to specific Tasks. These files are automatically copied to the new project without further action. Your files are copied and the originals are not affected in any way.
“Import related forums” does exactly what it describes. These forums – but not postings – are copied to the new project without further action. Your forums are copied and the originals are not affected in any way.

I> At the time of this writing, all budgetary fields are merely for documentation purposes and are not used for tracking, evaluation, or reporting in any way.

### Project Ownership / Company Filtering

One of the most common problems users face after they save their first project is that it seems to disappear. Normally the project still exists and no data was lost, but the user is unable to find it. When looking at the Project List screen, there is a dropdown in the upper left corner called “Company/ Division” (pictured below). This provides filtering to see projects for any individual company at a time. By changing this dropdown to “All”, all projects for any company the user has permissions for will be displayed.
