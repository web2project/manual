# Best Practices

This section addresses some of the most common practices that will assist you in using Web2project successfully.

Your organization probably has a process for managing projects. Web2project has a process for managing projects. These two processes may not be entirely compatible, therefore you must determine which portions of each process are the most important to your organization and fulfill its requirements.

In the System Administration, there are a variety of configuration options available. After installation, customize them to your systems immediately.

All email notifications generated by Web2project will use the “Email Prefix” setting. Setting this to something distinctive – CaseySoftware uses “[cs-w2p]” – allows users to filter notifications accordingly.

If you are integrating Web2project with an existing security infrastructure, the LDAP configuration is a flexible and powerful option available here.

New Users cannot log in until they have been assigned a Role. The four base roles in Web2project are sufficient for many organizations but can be customized as necessary.

Whenever you think your Company, Project, or Task is missing from the list screen, check your Filters (upper right-hand corner) before you do anything else.

More information – not less – is always better. The information attached to your Companies, Projects, and Tasks is indexed in SmartSearch and will allow for greater and more flexible permissions as your requirements change.

Avoid choosing similar colors or names for Projects. Throughout the system, these two aspects are used to denote start and end dates on the Calendar, enumerate tasks on individual Task Lists, and even in the Project List. Being able to quickly glance for specific projects and tasks makes using the system much simpler and faster.

Customizing Web2project field labels for your organization can be done through the System Admin. The existing “Translation Management” serves as a useful foundation for “Jargon Management”.

Although the latest development version of Web2project – called `develop` – often has the most advanced, creative, and therefore fun features, it is also the most unstable due to lack of testing and beta usage. It is not recommended to use this version in a production environment.

For development and testing purposes, it is suggested to backup your database to a local development machine and use a local Apache-MySQL-PHP application stack. On Windows workstations, a common solution for this is XAMPP.


## Security Considerations

At the time of this writing, there are no known issues with the latest Web2project release (v3.1.0) but there are three primary steps which have been taken to prevent most issues.

* First, we filter all input with the assumption that it is not safe by default.
* Next, we implemented a simple .htaccess script modeled after Drupal’s .htaccess. This prevents anyone from accessing files other than an enumerated list.
* Finally, since the first solution was only effective in an Apache environment, we have inserted a simple sentinel function to prevent unauthorized access.

Regardless of the above steps, care should be taken to limit ftp and database access to authorized and trusted individuals and to ensure that your directory and file permissions are configured properly.

W> Turn off register_globals. This feature has been deprecated as of 5.3 and removed as of 5.4. It should not exist as an option anymore for the vast majority of users.

W> Damage caused to your Web2project system by granting inappropriate access to individuals are usually due to your organization’s practices and absolutely nothing to do with Web2project.

## Maintenance

The only maintenance for Web2project is the Queue Scanner. If you enable the queuing of email notifications, a cron task must be configured to hit this file on a regular basis. This script will parse the queue every 10 minutes and can be adjusted as necessary:

*/10	* * * *	wget –O - -w http://{web2project-install}/queuescanner.php

There are no other maintenance tasks required by Web2project. It is strongly suggested that you apply your MySQL tuning and maintenance tasks to the Web2project database in accordance with your current policies.

## Backup

The most direct and simplest way to backup Web2project is to use MySQL’s built in mysqldump command. For further information on this utility and its usage, please reference the MySQL Users’ Manual. While every organization’s practices will vary depending on their requirements and capabilities, it is suggested to back up your Web2project database on a regular basis.
